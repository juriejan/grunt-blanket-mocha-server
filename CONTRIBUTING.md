Contributions, as feedback in the [issues list](issues) or as pull requests, are encouraged.

For pull requests:

* In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing
coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
* Yes, please use CoffeeScript.
* Yes, please ensure that all code is **covered** by tests! It's a very simple grunt task, people -- setting
up the test framework was more work than authoring the task -- coverage
is a walk in the park. :)  Just run `grunt test` -- unit tests are reported to the console, and if they succeed,
then coverage stats are also reported in the console and the html report is made available at `'./test/coverage.html'`.
